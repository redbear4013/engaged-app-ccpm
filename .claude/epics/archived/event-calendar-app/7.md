# Task: Calendar Integration

## Description

Implement comprehensive calendar system with multi-view display, conflict detection, and event synchronization. Build intuitive interface for managing personal schedules and discovering events with intelligent recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Multi-view calendar (month, week, day, agenda views)
- [ ] Personal event management (add, edit, delete, recurring events)
- [ ] Conflict detection with smart scheduling suggestions
- [ ] External calendar synchronization (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- [ ] Event invitation and RSVP system
- [ ] Drag-and-drop event scheduling interface
- [ ] Calendar sharing and collaboration features
- [ ] Offline support with sync when connected
- [ ] Mobile-responsive calendar interface

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**:
  - React Big Calendar or FullCalendar for core calendar UI
  - CalDAV/iCal integration for external calendar sync
  - WebSocket connections for real-time collaboration
  - IndexedDB for offline storage and synchronization
  - Conflict resolution algorithms for scheduling
- **Key considerations**:
  - Handle timezone complexities and daylight saving
  - Implement efficient conflict detection algorithms
  - Design robust sync mechanism with external calendars
  - Ensure smooth performance with large numbers of events
  - Handle offline/online state transitions gracefully
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `/src/components/calendar/CalendarView.tsx` - Main calendar component
  - `/src/components/calendar/EventModal.tsx` - Event creation/editing
  - `/src/services/calendar-sync.ts` - External calendar integration
  - `/src/utils/conflict-detection.ts` - Scheduling conflict logic
  - `/src/hooks/useCalendar.ts` - Calendar state management
  - `/src/api/calendar/` - Calendar API endpoints

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2: Database Schema Setup (calendar and user tables)
- [ ] Task 3: Project Setup and Configuration (React setup)
- [ ] Task 4: Authentication and User Management (user sessions)
- [ ] External calendar API credentials (Google, Microsoft)
- [ ] WebSocket infrastructure for real-time features
- [ ] Background job system for sync operations

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XL
- Hours: 32-40 hours
- Parallel: false (requires API foundation to be complete)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented with all calendar views and features
- [ ] Unit tests for conflict detection and sync logic
- [ ] Integration tests with external calendar services
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete user workflows
- [ ] Performance tests with large event datasets
- [ ] Accessibility tests for calendar navigation
- [ ] Cross-platform testing (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- [ ] Timezone handling tests across multiple regions
- [ ] Documentation for calendar API and integration
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging with monitoring and analytics
