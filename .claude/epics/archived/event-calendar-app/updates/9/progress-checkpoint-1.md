### 🎯 React Hooks
- ✅ **Subscription Hooks** (`src/hooks/use-subscription.ts`):
  - `useSubscription()`: Get subscription status and usage limits
  - `useCreateCheckoutSession()`: Handle upgrade flow
  - `useBillingPortal()`: Manage billing portal access
  - `useUsageLimits()`: Track daily usage
  - `useSwipe()`: Record swipe actions

### 🎨 UI Components
- ✅ **Base UI Components**: Button, Card, Badge, Alert (Tailwind + Radix UI)

  - `PricingPage`: Complete pricing interface with FAQ

- ✅ **Subscription Management**:
  - `SubscriptionDashboard`: Usage stats, billing info, payment history
  - `FeatureGate`: Premium feature access control with upgrade prompts
  - `SwipeLimitWarning`: Daily limit notifications

### 📱 Pages & Routes
- ✅ **Pricing Page** (`/pricing`): Public pricing and plan comparison
- ✅ **Success Page** (`/subscription/success`): Post-payment confirmation
- ✅ **Canceled Page** (`/subscription/canceled`): Checkout cancellation handling

### 🧪 Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ **Service Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for SubscriptionService and UsageService
- ✅ **Mock Setup**: Proper Jest mocking for Stripe and Supabase dependencies

- Compliance and legal (Ready for review)

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**: Test complete subscription flow in development environment
2. **Email Notifications**: Implement subscription lifecycle email notifications
3. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
4. **Production Setup**: Configure Stripe production environment
5. **Security Review**: Conduct security audit of payment processing
6. **Feature Integration**: Integrate feature gates into existing app components

## Technical Debt / Notes

- Jest configuration may need adjustment for better path resolution in tests
- Consider adding retry logic for failed Stripe operations
- Implement rate limiting for subscription-related endpoints
- Add monitoring and alerting for webhook failures

## Estimated Completion: 85%

The core subscription system is fully implemented and ready for integration testing. The remaining 15% consists primarily of email notifications, production configuration, and integration with existing app features.
