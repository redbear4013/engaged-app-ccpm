# Task: Performance Optimization & Production Deployment

## Description

Optimize the application for production deployment with focus on Core Web Vitals, SEO, caching strategies, and establishing CI/CD pipeline with monitoring. This includes performance auditing, optimization implementation, and production infrastructure setup.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core Web Vitals scores: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- [ ] SEO optimization with meta tags, structured data, sitemap
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented (Redis for sessions, CDN for assets)
- [ ] Image optimization and lazy loading
- [ ] Code splitting and bundle optimization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Production monitoring and error tracking
- [ ] Database query optimization and indexing
- [ ] SSL certificate and security headers configured

## Technical Details

- Performance audit using Lighthouse and WebPageTest
- Next.js optimization features (Image component, dynamic imports)
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- CDN setup for static assets (images, CSS, JS)
- Database query analysis and index optimization
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar
- Error tracking with Sentry or similar service
- Application monitoring with performance metrics
- Security best practices implementation

## Dependencies

- [ ] Core application features completed (Task 6)
- [ ] Production hosting environment (AWS, Vercel, or similar)
- [ ] Domain name and DNS configuration
- [ ] SSL certificate provider
- [ ] CDN service (CloudFlare, AWS CloudFront)
- [ ] Monitoring service accounts (Sentry, DataDog, etc.)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XL
- Hours: 32-40 hours
- Parallel: false (requires completed application)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Lighthouse performance score > 90
- [ ] All Core Web Vitals in green
- [ ] SEO audit passing with structured data
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented and tested
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploying successfully
- [ ] Production monitoring active with alerts
- [ ] Security headers and HTTPS configured
- [ ] Database performance optimized
