# Task: Database Schema & Supabase Setup

## Description

Set up the Supabase project and create all necessary database tables, relationships, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies for the event calendar application. This includes creating tables for users, events, event types, attendees, and any necessary junction tables for many-to-many relationships.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Proper foreign key relationships established
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- [ ] Database functions created for complex queries
- [ ] Indexes added for performance optimization
- [ ] Authentication configuration completed

## Technical Details

- Create users table with extended profile information

- Attendees table for event RSVPs and attendance tracking
- RLS policies to ensure users can only access their events and events they're invited to
- Database functions for recurring events, conflict detection, availability checks
- Proper indexing on date fields and foreign keys

## Dependencies

- [ ] Supabase account and project setup
- [ ] Database design documentation review

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true (can run in parallel with project setup)

## Definition of Done
