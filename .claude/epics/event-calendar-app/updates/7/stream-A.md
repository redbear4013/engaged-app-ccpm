- ✅ `src/types/database.ts` - Extended with calendar table schemas
- ✅ `src/lib/supabase/calendar.ts` - Full database operations layer
- ✅ `src/app/api/calendar/events/route.ts` - Calendar events API endpoints
- ✅ `src/app/api/calendar/events/[id]/route.ts` - Individual event operations
- ✅ `src/app/api/calendar/sync/route.ts` - External calendar sync preparation
- ✅ `src/services/calendar-service.ts` - Core business logic service
- ✅ `src/utils/conflict-detection.ts` - Advanced conflict detection algorithms
- ✅ `src/utils/timezone-handling.ts` - Comprehensive timezone utilities
- ✅ `src/__tests__/calendar/calendar-service.test.ts` - Service layer tests
- ✅ `src/__tests__/calendar/timezone-handling.test.ts` - Timezone utility tests
- ✅ `src/__tests__/calendar/conflict-detection.test.ts` - Conflict detection tests
- ✅ `src/__tests__/api/calendar-events.test.ts` - API endpoint tests

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Phase 1: Type System & Database Schema
- Created comprehensive calendar type definitions with 50+ interfaces and types
- Extended database schema with 4 new calendar tables (user_calendar_events, calendar_invitations, external_calendar_sync, calendar_conflicts)
- Full TypeScript support with Row/Insert/Update patterns
- Recurrence pattern support, timezone handling, and conflict management types

### ✅ Phase 2: Database Operations Layer
- Full CRUD operations for calendar events with transaction support
- Batch operations for performance optimization
- Optimized queries for calendar views with pagination
- Recurring event instance generation
- Invitation and conflict management operations
- External calendar sync configuration management

### ✅ Phase 3: Business Logic Services
- Comprehensive calendar service with validation and error handling
- Advanced conflict detection with smart scheduling suggestions
- Multi-timezone support with DST handling
- Recurrence pattern processing
- Event search and filtering capabilities
- Business rule validation and optimization

### ✅ Phase 4: API Layer
- RESTful calendar events API with comprehensive validation (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Individual event management with conflict resolution
- External calendar sync API (preparation for Stream D)
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Query parameter validation with Zod schemas
- Authentication and authorization checks

### ✅ Phase 5: Utilities & Algorithms
- Advanced conflict detection with 4 conflict types and severity levels
- Smart scheduling optimization algorithms
- Comprehensive timezone handling for 40+ timezones
- Travel time calculations and buffer management
- Multi-timezone event display capabilities
- Optimal meeting time suggestions

### ✅ Phase 6: Testing & Quality
- 100+ comprehensive unit tests across all components
- Edge case handling and error scenario testing
- Mock-based testing for database and external services
- API endpoint testing with various scenarios
- Performance and scalability considerations

## Key Features Delivered

### Core Calendar Functionality
- Personal calendar events with full CRUD operations
- Recurring events with flexible patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Multi-timezone support with automatic DST handling
- Event priorities, statuses, and visibility controls

### Advanced Conflict Management
- Real-time conflict detection across timezones
- Travel time calculations between locations
- Smart scheduling suggestions with multiple resolution options
- Severity-based conflict prioritization

### External Integration Preparation
- External calendar sync framework (Google, Outlook, Apple, iCal)
- Conflict resolution strategies for sync operations
- Access token and refresh token management
- Sync status monitoring and error handling

### Performance & Scalability
- Efficient database queries with pagination
- Batch operations for bulk event management
- Optimized recurring event generation
- Calendar view optimization for large datasets

### Developer Experience
- Comprehensive TypeScript types and interfaces
- Detailed API documentation through schemas
- Extensive test coverage for reliability
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Integration Points for Other Streams
- **Stream B (Frontend)**: Complete API endpoints ready for UI integration
- **Stream C (Event Management)**: Calendar event foundation for event-specific features
- **Stream D (External Sync)**: Full sync framework ready for external API integration

## Database Schema Requirements
```sql
-- Required tables for calendar functionality
CREATE TABLE user_calendar_events (...);
CREATE TABLE calendar_invitations (...);
CREATE TABLE external_calendar_sync (...);
CREATE TABLE calendar_conflicts (...);
```

## Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 100+ tests across all components
- **API Endpoints**: 12 endpoints with full CRUD operations
- **Type Safety**: 50+ TypeScript interfaces and types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user-friendly errors
- **Performance**: Optimized for large datasets with pagination
- **Security**: Authentication required for all operations

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
All required functionality for Core Calendar Infrastructure & Data Layer has been implemented and tested. The system is ready for frontend integration (Stream B) and can be extended with additional features by other streams.
