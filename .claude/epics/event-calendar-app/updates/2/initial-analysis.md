# Issue #2: Database Schema & Supabase Setup - Initial Analysis

## Requirements Analysis

Based on the epic and PRD review, the database needs to support:

### Core Entities

1. **Users** - Authentication and profiles with AI matching preferences
2. **Events** - Core event data with rich metadata for AI matching
3. **Event Categories** - Classification system for events
4. **User Event Interactions** - Swipes, saves, attendance tracking
5. **Membership** - Pro subscription management
6. **Organizers** - Separate organizer entity for event management
7. **Venues** - Location and venue information
8. **Event Sources** - For scraping pipeline tracking

### Key Requirements

- Support 50k events and 20k users
- AI matching data structure for user preferences
- Event scraping pipeline data models
- Pro membership feature flags and billing data
- Calendar integration requirements
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

### Technical Approach

1. Create comprehensive schema with proper relationships
2. Implement RLS policies for security
3. Add indexes for performance (date fields, foreign keys)
4. Create database functions for complex operations
5. Set up authentication configuration
6. Include seed data for testing

## Implementation Plan

1. Core tables schema (users, events, categories, venues)
2. Interaction tables (swipes, saves, attendance)
3. Membership and billing tables
4. Scraping pipeline tables
5. RLS policies implementation
6. Database functions and triggers
7. Indexes and performance optimizations
8. Authentication configuration
9. Initial seed data

## Progress Status

- [x] Requirements analysis complete
- [ ] Core schema implementation
- [ ] RLS policies
- [ ] Database functions
- [ ] Authentication setup
- [ ] Testing and validation
