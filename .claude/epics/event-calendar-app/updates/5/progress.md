- **Merge strategies** for updating existing events

### âœ… 4. Background Job System
- **Bull queue implementation** with Redis backend
- **Multiple job types** (single source, bulk, health checks)
- **Configurable concurrency** and retry logic
- **Job monitoring** with detailed status tracking
- **Queue management** (pause, resume, cleanup, retry)

### âœ… 5. Source Configuration Management
- **Dynamic source loading** from JSON config and database
- **Source lifecycle management** (create, update, activate, deactivate)
- **Error tracking** with automatic deactivation
- **Scheduling management** with configurable frequencies
- **Source metrics** and health monitoring

### âœ… 6. Monitoring & Metrics
- **Comprehensive health checks** for all system components
- **Real-time metrics** (error rates, job counts, performance)
- **Queue statistics** (waiting, active, failed, completed jobs)
- **Scheduler status** monitoring
- **Redis connection health** checks
