# Task: Project Setup & Architecture

## Description
Initialize the Next.js project with TypeScript, set up the development environment, install all necessary dependencies, and establish the project architecture. Configure Tailwind CSS for styling, set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality, and create the basic folder structure for a scalable application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Next.js 14+ project initialized with TypeScript
- [ ] Tailwind CSS configured and working
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured with consistent rules
- [ ] Project folder structure created (components, pages, utils, types, etc.)
- [ ] Environment variables template created
- [ ] Package.json scripts configured for development workflow
- [ ] Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- [ ] Development server running successfully

## Technical Details
- Use Next.js App Router for modern routing
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode
- Set up Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- Install and configure: @supabase/supabase-js, @types/node, date-fns or similar
- Create folder structure: /components, /app, /lib, /types, /utils, /hooks
- Configure absolute imports with TypeScript paths
- Set up development scripts: dev, build, lint, format

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js environment setup
- [ ] Package manager selection (npm/yarn/pnpm)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (can run in parallel with database setup)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Project successfully initialized and building
- [ ] All dependencies installed and configured
- [ ] Development server starts without errors
- [ ] Linting and formatting rules working
- [ ] Folder structure documented
- [ ] Environment configuration documented
- [ ] Basic layout and routing structure created
