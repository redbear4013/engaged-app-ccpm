# Task: Discover Landing Page

## Description
Create server-rendered discovery landing page with dynamic sections for event exploration. Implement trending events, nearby events, and top 10 curated lists with responsive event cards and optimized performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Server-side rendered landing page with SEO optimization
- [ ] Trending Events section with algorithmic ranking
- [ ] Nearby Events section with geolocation integration
- [ ] Top 10 Events curated list with admin management
- [ ] Responsive event cards with consistent design system
- [ ] Infinite scroll or pagination for large event lists
- [ ] Search functionality with real-time filtering
- [ ] Performance optimization (lazy loading, caching)
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Next.js App Router with server components
  - Tailwind CSS for responsive design system
  - React Query for client-side state management
  - Geolocation API for proximity calculations
  - PostgreSQL queries optimized for performance
- **Key considerations**:
  - Balance server vs client rendering for performance
  - Implement efficient caching strategies
  - Design scalable event card component system
  - Handle loading states and error boundaries gracefully
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `/src/app/discover/page.tsx` - Main landing page
  - `/src/components/events/EventCard.tsx` - Reusable event card
  - `/src/components/sections/TrendingEvents.tsx` - Trending section
  - `/src/components/sections/NearbyEvents.tsx` - Location-based section
  - `/src/lib/queries/events.ts` - Database queries
  - `/src/hooks/useGeolocation.ts` - Location utilities

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Database Schema Setup (event queries)
- [ ] Task 002: Project Setup and Configuration (Next.js)
- [ ] Geolocation permissions and privacy handling
- [ ] Image optimization and CDN configuration
- [ ] Analytics tracking setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-28 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside backend development)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Component tests for event cards and sections
- [ ] Integration tests for data loading and filtering
- [ ] Accessibility tests with automated tools
- [ ] Performance tests (Core Web Vitals compliance)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing on major platforms
- [ ] Responsive design testing on multiple devices
- [ ] SEO validation with structured data markup
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging with analytics tracking
