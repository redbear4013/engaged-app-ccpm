# Task: Event Scraping Pipeline

## Description
Implement automated event scraping pipeline using Playwright + Firecrawl for data collection, processing, and deduplication. Build robust system for discovering events from multiple sources and maintaining data quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Playwright automation framework setup with multiple source adapters
- [ ] Firecrawl integration for content extraction and structured data parsing
- [ ] Event data processing pipeline with validation and normalization
- [ ] Deduplication logic using fuzzy matching (title, date, location)
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms for failed scrapes
- [ ] Configurable scraping schedules and source management
- [ ] Data quality metrics and monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Rate limiting and respectful scraping practices

## Technical Details
- **Implementation approach**:
  - Playwright for browser automation and navigation
  - Firecrawl for intelligent content extraction
  - Background job processing with queue system
  - PostgreSQL for storing raw and processed event data
- **Key considerations**:
  - Handle dynamic content and JavaScript-heavy sites
  - Implement robust error handling for unreliable sources
  - Design scalable architecture for adding new sources
  - Ensure data consistency and avoid duplicates
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `/src/services/scraping/` - Core scraping service
  - `/src/workers/event-scraper.js` - Background worker
  - `/src/utils/deduplication.js` - Duplicate detection
  - `/src/config/sources.json` - Source configurations

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Database Schema Setup (PostgreSQL tables)
- [ ] Playwright installation and configuration
- [ ] Firecrawl API access and authentication
- [ ] Background job processing system (Bull/Agenda)
- [ ] Redis for job queues and caching

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 24-32 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside frontend development)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full scraping pipeline
- [ ] Unit tests for deduplication and data processing logic
- [ ] Integration tests with mock event sources
- [ ] Error handling tests for network failures and malformed data
- [ ] Performance tests for large-scale scraping operations
- [ ] Documentation for adding new event sources
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Deployed to staging with monitoring enabled
