# Add Comprehensive API Logging

## Description

Apply enhanced error logging pattern to all API routes. This will provide actionable debugging information across the entire API surface, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All API routes log request details (method, URL, headers, params)
- [ ] Database operations log full error context (message, details, hint, code)
- [ ] Error logs are actionable and include stack traces
- [ ] Logging doesn't expose sensitive user data

## Technical Details

- Apply logging pattern from `ai-matching-service.ts` to all routes
- Log authentication failures with specific reasons
- Add request IDs for tracing
- Monitor error rates in development
- Files affected: All files in `src/app/api/**/*.ts`

## Effort Estimate

M (8-12 hours)

## Priority

P0 - Critical for debugging and fixing issues

## Parallel Execution

This task can run alongside tasks 001 and 002, but should be coordinated with 001 to avoid merge conflicts.

## Dependencies

None

## Conflicts

- **Task 001**: Both tasks modify API route files, particularly the calendar events route. Coordination needed to avoid merge conflicts.
