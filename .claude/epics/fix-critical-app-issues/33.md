# Task 010: Performance Testing & Monitoring

**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** M (8-12 hours)
**Parallel:** false (run after all fixes complete)

## Description

Benchmark performance and add monitoring for production readiness to ensure the app can handle realistic load.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Calendar API response time < 500ms (month view, 100 events)
- [ ] Event save operation < 1s
- [ ] Load testing with 1000+ events passes
- [ ] Performance metrics logged for monitoring

## Technical Details

- Benchmark calendar API with different data sizes
- Test concurrent users (simulate 10+ simultaneous requests)
- Add performance logging to critical paths
- Identify and optimize slow queries
- Create performance baseline document
- Files affected: `src/lib/performance.ts`, API routes (add timing logs)

## Dependencies

- **Depends on:** Tasks 001, 25, 006 (needs working APIs and clean data)
- **Conflicts with:** None

## Notes

This is a validation task that should be run after core fixes are complete. It ensures the app is production-ready and helps identify any performance bottlenecks before launch. This task is not parallel because it depends on multiple other tasks being completed first.
