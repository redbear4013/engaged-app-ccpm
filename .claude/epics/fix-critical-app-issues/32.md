# Task 009: Run Macau Event Scrapers

**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** S (4-6 hours)
**Parallel:** true (can run alongside other tasks)

## Description

Run event scrapers to populate database with Macau events from Broadway, MGTO, and Galaxy sources.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 50 Macau events in database
- [ ] Events from Broadway, MGTO, and Galaxy sources
- [ ] All scraped events pass validation (event_type='event')
- [ ] Event quality score > 95% (valid dates, venues, descriptions)

## Technical Details

- Verify environment variables configured (USE_UNIVERSAL_SCRAPER=true)
- Test Broadway scraper: `npm run scrape:test -- --source=broadway`
- Test MGTO scraper: `npm run scrape:test -- --source=mgto`
- Run full scrape: `npm run scrape:macau`
- Verify event quality in database
- Check image URLs are valid
- Files affected: Database (events table populated)

## Dependencies

- **Depends on:** Task 004 (needs validation enforcement first)
- **Conflicts with:** None

## Notes

This task focuses on data population. The scrapers are already implemented - we just need to run them and verify the data quality. Running this after Task 004 ensures all scraped events meet validation requirements.
