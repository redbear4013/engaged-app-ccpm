SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Cloudflare CDN (optional)
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID=your-zone-id
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

- Cache control: 30 days

## Implementation Details

### Key Design Decisions

1. **ETag Support**: Implemented conditional GET to avoid re-downloading unchanged images
2. **Streaming Downloads**: Stream-based download with size checking to prevent memory issues
3. **Parallel Processing**: All size variants processed in parallel for performance
4. **Content Hashing**: SHA-256 hashing at multiple stages (download, each variant)
5. **Deduplication Strategy**: Hash-based deduplication in separate `/hashes/` folder
6. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with retry logic
7. **Batch Operations**: Controlled concurrency for batch downloads/processing/uploads

### Performance Characteristics

- **Download**: 30s timeout, 3 retries with exponential backoff
- **Processing**: <3s for all variants (on typical hardware)
- **Deduplication**: Expected 40-60% storage reduction
- **Batch Operations**: Configurable concurrency (default 3-5)

### Security Considerations

- RLS policies enforce service-role-only writes
- Public read access for served images
- User-specific access for owned events
- Service role key required for all operations
- MIME type validation prevents non-image uploads
