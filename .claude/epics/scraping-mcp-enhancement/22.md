- [ ] Alert thresholds tuned based on production data
- [ ] Performance optimizations implemented
- [ ] Stakeholder demo delivered
- [ ] Launch approval obtained
- [ ] Production metrics baselined
- [ ] On-call procedures validated
- [ ] Launch announcement prepared

## Technical Details

### 48-Hour Burn-In Period

**Objectives**:
- Validate system stability under real production conditions
- Collect baseline metrics for alert threshold tuning
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Verify circuit breaker behavior
- Test recovery from transient failures

**Monitoring Focus Areas**:

1. **Success Rate**
   - Target: >99% successful scraping runs
   - Metric: `successful_runs / total_runs`
   - Alert: <95% over 6-hour window

2. **Extraction Speed**
   - Target: <2s p95 per page
   - Metric: Time from request to parsed events
   - Alert: p95 >5s for any source

3. **Run Duration**
   - Target: <15 min p95 for full orchestrator run
   - Metric: Total orchestrator execution time
   - Alert: p95 >20 min

4. **Field Coverage**
   - Target: >90% average across all sources
   - Metric: `fields_populated / required_fields`
   - Alert: <80% for any Priority 1 source

5. **Error Rate**
   - Target: <1% error rate per source
   - Metric: `errors / total_attempts`
   - Alert: >5% error rate for any source

6. **Circuit Breaker Activations**
   - Target: <2 activations per source during burn-in
   - Metric: Circuit state transitions to OPEN
   - Alert: >3 activations for any Priority 1 source

**Burn-In Dashboard**:
- Real-time metrics visualization
- Hourly snapshots for trend analysis
- Alert history with resolution status
- Performance percentiles (p50, p90, p95, p99)

**Data Collection**:
```sql
-- Burn-in metrics query
SELECT
  source_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_runs,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'success' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful_runs,
  AVG(duration_ms) as avg_duration,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY duration_ms) as p95_duration,
  AVG(events_found) as avg_events,
  AVG(field_coverage) as avg_coverage,
  SUM(CASE WHEN error IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as error_count
FROM scraping_runs
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '48 hours'
GROUP BY source_id
ORDER BY source_id;
```

### Alert Threshold Tuning

**Current Thresholds** (pre-burn-in):
- Error rate: >10% â†’ Warning
- Zero events from Priority 1: Critical
- Coverage drop: >30% â†’ Warning
- p95 runtime: >2Ã— baseline â†’ Warning
- Circuit open for Priority 1: Critical

**Tuning Process**:

1. **Collect Baseline Data**:
   - Analyze burn-in metrics for each threshold
   - Identify false positive alerts
   - Identify missed issues (false negatives)

2. **Calculate Optimal Thresholds**:
   - Use statistical methods (e.g., 3-sigma rule)
   - Consider business impact vs. alert fatigue
   - Set different thresholds for Priority 1 vs. 2-3

3. **Update Alert Configuration**:
```typescript
// src/config/alerts.ts
export const ALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
  errorRate: {
    priority1: { warning: 0.05, critical: 0.15 },  // Tuned from burn-in
    priority2_3: { warning: 0.10, critical: 0.25 },
  },
  coverage: {
    priority1: { warning: 0.85, critical: 0.70 },  // Tuned from burn-in
    priority2_3: { warning: 0.75, critical: 0.60 },
  },
  runtime: {
    p95_multiplier: { warning: 2.5, critical: 4.0 },  // Tuned from burn-in
  },
  zeroEvents: {
    priority1: 'critical',  // No change
    priority2_3: 'warning',
  },
};
```

4. **Validate New Thresholds**:
   - Apply retroactively to burn-in data
   - Confirm reduction in false positives
   - Ensure no critical issues missed

### Performance Optimization

**Optimization Areas** (based on burn-in findings):

1. **Concurrency Tuning**
   - Current: `maxConcurrent=3`
   - Test: Increase to 5 if p95 runtime >12 min
   - Validate: No resource exhaustion on GitHub Actions runners

2. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Analyze slow queries from `scraping_logs`
   - Add indexes for frequent query patterns
   - Optimize deduplication query performance

3. **Image Optimization**
   - Current: Resize to 1600px, WebP conversion
   - Optimize: Parallel processing, stream-based conversion
   - Target: <3s per image (down from <5s)

4. **Tool Selection Optimization**
   - Analyze tool success rates from burn-in
   - Promote successful engines to primary for specific sources
   - Example: If DevTools succeeds 100% for Broadway, skip Firecrawl

5. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement ETag-based HTTP caching for unchanged pages
   - Cache selector mappings to reduce initialization time
   - Cache image downloads (content-hash based)

**Optimization Example**:
```typescript
// Before: Sequential image processing
for (const image of images) {
  await processImage(image);
}

// After: Parallel with concurrency limit
await Promise.all(
  images.map(image => limitConcurrency(() => processImage(image), 5))
);
```
