## AI Matching System

### Preference Scoring Algorithm
The `calculate_event_score()` function implements a sophisticated scoring system:

```sql
Base Score: 50 points
+ Category Match: 25 points
+ Time Preference: 20 points
+ Price Range: 15 points
+ Location Match: 20 points
+ Popularity: up to 10 points
+ Quality: up to 10 points
+ Featured/Trending: 5 points each
```

### Recommendation Engine
- `get_user_recommendations()`: Returns personalized event list
- Excludes already-swiped events
- Ordered by AI score and event timing
- Supports pagination for mobile app performance

## Security (RLS Policies)

### User Data Protection
- Users can only access their own profiles, swipes, and saved events
- Public profiles are viewable by authenticated users
- Organizers can only manage their own events
- Analytics data is restricted to relevant parties

### System Access
- Service role has full access for system operations
- Scraping pipeline isolated from user data
- Payment data requires special permissions

### Key Security Features
- JWT token validation on all operations
- User isolation at database level
- Audit trails for sensitive operations
- Rate limiting through usage tracking

## Performance Optimizations

### Strategic Indexes
```sql
-- Event discovery
idx_events_city_date      - Location + time queries
idx_events_text_search    - Full-text search
idx_events_status         - Published event filtering

-- User interactions
idx_user_swipes_user_id   - User's swipe history
idx_user_events_user_id   - User's calendar events

-- Analytics
idx_event_analytics_event_date - Event performance tracking
idx_user_analytics_user_date   - User behavior analysis
```

### Query Optimization
- Views for common joins (`active_events_view`, `user_calendar_view`)
- Computed columns for frequently calculated values
- Partitioning strategy for analytics tables (future)

## Real-time Features

### Supabase Subscriptions
Tables optimized for real-time subscriptions:
- `events`: Live event updates
- `user_events`: Calendar synchronization
- `event_analytics`: Live popularity tracking

### Trigger-based Updates
- Automatic popularity score calculation
- Real-time analytics updates
- Pro membership synchronization

## Scaling Considerations

### Current Capacity
- **Events**: 50,000 events with efficient querying
- **Users**: 20,000 users with personalized recommendations
- **Analytics**: 90-day retention with cleanup automation

### Future Scaling
- Table partitioning for analytics data
- Read replicas for high-traffic queries
- Materialized views for complex aggregations
- Archive strategy for historical data

## Development Setup

### Local Development
1. Install Supabase CLI
2. Run `supabase start`

supabase gen types typescript --local > types/database.types.ts
```

## API Integration

```

**Check Event Conflicts:**

```

**Get Trending Events:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.get_trending_events(10);
```
