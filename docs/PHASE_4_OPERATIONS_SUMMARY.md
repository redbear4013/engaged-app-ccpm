## Issue #32: Run Macau Event Scrapers

### Current State Analysis

#### ✅ Infrastructure Complete
The event scraping system is **fully implemented** with the following components:

**Core Components:**
- `src/services/scraping/scraper.ts` - Playwright-based scraper with validation
- `src/services/scraping/event-validator.ts` - Comprehensive validation (Phase 1 integration ✅)
- `src/services/scraping/scheduler.ts` - Automated scheduling system
- `src/workers/event-scraper.ts` - Worker process with direct scraping support
- `src/config/sources.json` - Macau event source configurations

**Validation Integration (Phase 1):**
```typescript
// scraper.ts line 115-122
const validationResults = validateEvents(events)
logValidationStats(validationResults)

// Return only valid events (both events and attractions)
const validEvents = [...validationResults.valid, ...validationResults.attractions]
```

**Event Sources Configured:**
1. Eventbrite Macau
2. Macau Cultural Venues (ICM)
3. Additional sources in `sources.json`

#### ⚠️ Known Issues

**Redis Queue Disabled:**
- Bull queue requires Redis (not available in current setup)
- Worker has **direct scraping mode** as fallback
- Scheduler needs update to use direct mode (see SCRAPER_STATUS.md)

**Impact:**
- Automated scheduling: ❌ Not functional
- Manual/direct scraping: ✅ Works
- Event validation: ✅ Fully integrated

### Validation System Working

**Phase 1 Integration Complete:**
- ✅ Invalid events filtered during scraping
- ✅ Navigation menu items rejected
- ✅ Short titles/descriptions blocked
- ✅ Date range validation (60 days past, 2 years future)
- ✅ Venue/location requirements enforced
- ✅ Statistics logged for each scrape

**Example Validation Output:**
```
=== Event Validation Statistics ===
Total scraped: 150
Valid events: 128
Valid attractions: 12
Invalid/Rejected: 10
Validation rate: 93.33%

Rejection Reasons:
  - Title matches navigation/menu pattern: 6
  - Missing venue/location: 3
  - Title too short: 1
===================================
```

### Manual Scraping Options

**Option 1: Direct Worker Execution**
```bash
npx tsx src/workers/event-scraper.ts
```

**Option 2: Test Scripts**
```bash
# Test specific source
npx tsx src/workers/test-scrape-detailed.ts

# Test Londoner venue
npx tsx src/workers/test-londoner.ts
```

**Option 3: API Endpoint** (if implemented)
```bash
POST /api/admin/scraping/start
{
  "sourceId": "eventbrite-macau"
}
```

### Recommendations for #32

**Short-term (For Testing):**
1. ✅ Use manual scraping via test scripts
2. ✅ Validation is working (Phase 1)
3. ✅ Events will be clean on import

**Long-term (Production):**
1. 🔧 Set up Redis for Bull queue
2. 🔧 Update scheduler to use direct mode as fallback
3. 🔧 Implement monitoring/alerting for scrape failures
4. 🔧 Add scraping dashboard in admin panel

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Manual scraping sufficient for initial data collection

## Issue #33: Performance Testing & Monitoring

### Current Performance State

#### ✅ Performance Infrastructure Exists

**Audit Scripts:**
```bash
# Run performance audit
npm run audit:performance

# Located at:
- scripts/performance-audit.js
- claudedocs/performance-audit.js
```

**Results Stored:**
- `claudedocs/performance-results/` - Historical audit data
- JSON format with full Lighthouse metrics

#### 📊 Baseline Metrics

**From Previous Audits** (claudedocs/performance-results/):

| Metric | Score | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Performance | TBD | Needs fresh audit |
| Accessibility | TBD | Needs fresh audit |
| Best Practices | TBD | Needs fresh audit |
| SEO | TBD | Needs fresh audit |

**Core Web Vitals:**
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): TBD
- FID (First Input Delay): TBD
- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): TBD

#### 🔍 Monitoring Capabilities

**Existing Tools:**
1. **API Logging** (Phase 3 ✅)
   - Request/response tracking
   - Error logging with context
   - Database operation timing

2. **Database Metrics**
   - Event counts: `/api/admin/events/stats`
   - Query performance: Via Supabase dashboard

3. **User Analytics**
   - Usage tracking: `src/services/usage-service.ts`
   - Swipe analytics: `src/hooks/use-ai-event-matching.ts`

### Performance Monitoring Setup

#### Quick Start: Run Performance Audit

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install lighthouse cli-progress

# Run audit (requires local server running)
npm run dev  # In terminal 1
npm run audit:performance  # In terminal 2
```

#### Monitoring Recommendations

**1. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**

Recommended Tools:
- **Vercel Analytics** (if deployed on Vercel)
  - Real user monitoring (RUM)
  - Core Web Vitals tracking
  - Free tier available

- **Sentry** (Error monitoring)
  - Error tracking with context
  - Performance monitoring
  - User session replay

- **PostHog** (Product analytics)
  - User behavior tracking
  - Feature usage analytics
  - Self-hosted option available

**2. Database Monitoring**

Via Supabase Dashboard:
- Query performance
- Table sizes and growth
- Connection pool usage
- Slow query log

**3. API Monitoring**

Current Logging (Phase 3):
```typescript
// Already implemented in key routes
logApiRequest(request)
logDatabaseError(error, operation)
logSuccess(operation, metrics)
```

**Enhancement Options:**
- Aggregate logs to monitoring service
- Set up alerts for error rate thresholds
- Track API response times

**4. User Experience Monitoring**

Metrics to Track:
- Time to interactive (TTI)
- First contentful paint (FCP)
- API response times (client-side)
- Error rates per user action

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Add to src/lib/analytics.ts
export function trackPerformance(metric: string, value: number) {
  // Send to analytics service
  console.log(`Performance: ${metric} = ${value}ms`)
}

// Usage in components
useEffect(() => {
  const start = performance.now()

  // ... operation ...

  const duration = performance.now() - start
  trackPerformance('event_load_time', duration)
}, [])
```

### Baseline Establishment Process

**Step 1: Run Fresh Performance Audit**
```bash
npm run dev
npm run audit:performance
```

**Step 2: Document Results**
```markdown
## Performance Baseline - [Date]

### Lighthouse Scores
- Performance: __/100
- Accessibility: __/100
- Best Practices: __/100
- SEO: __/100

### Core Web Vitals
- LCP: __ ms (target: <2.5s)
- FID: __ ms (target: <100ms)
- CLS: __ (target: <0.1)

### API Response Times
- Event listing: __ ms
- Event search: __ ms
- User auth: __ ms

### Database Metrics
- Total events: __
- Queries per second: __
- Average query time: __ ms
```

**Step 3: Set Monitoring Alerts**

Recommended Thresholds:
- API response time > 1000ms → Warning
- API response time > 3000ms → Alert
- Error rate > 1% → Warning
- Error rate > 5% → Alert
- Database query time > 500ms → Warning

### Recommendations for #33

**Immediate Actions:**
1. ✅ Logging infrastructure complete (Phase 3)
2. 🔧 Run fresh performance audit
3. 🔧 Document baseline metrics
4. 🔧 Set up basic monitoring (Vercel Analytics if on Vercel)

**Short-term (1-2 weeks):**
1. 🔧 Implement error tracking (Sentry)
2. 🔧 Add performance tracking to key user flows
3. 🔧 Set up database query monitoring
4. 🔧 Create monitoring dashboard

**Long-term (1-3 months):**
1. 🔧 Comprehensive APM solution
2. 🔧 Automated performance regression testing
3. 🔧 Real user monitoring (RUM)
4. 🔧 Performance budgets in CI/CD

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Basic logging exists, advanced monitoring can be added incrementally
